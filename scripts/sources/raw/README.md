Raw Sources
==========


These source files do not have headers as they are meant to be included from one of the final source files.

The way this is set up makes it easy to just hit "Recompile" in the script editor when a change has been made.

Copy and change the final source for the script you want. `PRESHAREDKEY` must match that of Harbinger Server
