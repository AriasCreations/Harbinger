Harbinger Source Code
=======

To use the Harbinger source code, you must have Preprocessor enabled, and set your includes folder to the Harbinger/scripts/includes folder.

Each script in here is prepared so you need only copy the contents to the script and hit save or recompile. 

NOTE: To set up your own delivery server, you must change the endpoints in Common.lsl to match that of your Harbinger instance.
